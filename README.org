My emacs setup, using  [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][emacs-prelude]].

This is a redo started in June 2015.  Previous repo: https://github.com/iani/emacs-prelude

Includes two own libraries through [[http://tapoueh.org/emacs/el-get.html][el-get]].

The main code is contained in: https://github.com/iani/emacs-init/blob/master/user/init.org

It is loaded through https://github.com/iani/emacs-init/blob/master/init.el using =org-babel-load-file=

Plans are to move the contents of the =preload=  and =packages= to separate repositories and use =el=get= to load these.
